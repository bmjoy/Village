prompt/villagersNotAssigned,Not all characters have been assigned to an action. Are you sure you want to end the turn?

tips/merchant,At the merchant you can exchange resources for gold. Traders have different offers every time. To use a trader assign the character to the trade action. Merchant is only present during the associated event.
tips/treatment,"Injured characters receive stat penalties. You can heal them with actions in the field hospital. Basic healing for herbs is not viable, consider building an herbalist hut and hospital quickly."
tips/watchtower,The watchtower gives you an extra turn to prepare for upcoming emergencies. It also extends the time to trade resources with the merchant.
tips/slotLocking,"By right-clicking on the action window, you can block a character from returning at the end of the next turn. Try not to block all actions, some actions should not be performed all the time."
tips/envoy,"Tharros and Salvante esteem allows you to get a better option of ending. The esteem can be earned by, among other things, fulfilling the demands of the appearing negotiators of the country."
tips/diplomacy,"Esteem can also be gained with the diplomacy action and the selling of precious gems. In addition to the basic stats, the reputation of a character also influences the results of both of these diplomatic actions."
tips/eventFolding,"Events can be collapsed by clicking on their title. This can be useful when there are too many of them, or to mark the completion of its conditions."
tips/well,Well allows you to obtain water more easily. The consistent gain frees up water-carrying characters for other uses.
tips/resourceUsage,"Resources can be used on the fly. If in a current turn you acquire the resources you need, for example, to construct a building, you can start constructing it in the same turn. An exception to this rule is when you trade with a merchant."
tips/intelligence,"After each chapter, characters increase their stats depending on their intelligence. Check if they can now perform better in other jobs."

messages/ending1/description,"Living conditions in the village were worsening day by day. The settlers had less and less strength, were more often ill and suffered from lack of basic resources. With time, the first deaths occurred, and the situation began to deteriorate. In the end, no one managed to survive even until the slowly returning conflict was resolved."
messages/ending2/description,"The time of truce is coming to an end. The inhabitants have failed to communicate with any of the representatives of the rulers.

Thanks to the efforts of the inhabitants, a neutral territory has been established and they are allowed to stay on the lands they know on condition of a continuous supply of precious stones to both countries. The inhabitants can thus lead a peaceful, modest life. It is not clear, however, whether and for how long this state of affairs can be maintained."
messages/prologue/description,"After a long, bloody, and fruitless territorial war between the kingdom of Tharros and the merchant oligarchy of Salvante, a temporary truce is called. Lead the people - deserters, surviving citizens, exiles - ensure their survival in these disputed lands. Fertile and rich in various natural resources, these lands are also full of dangers, such as dangerous animals and plunderers looking for easy loot."

game/help/description,"During each turn, assign villagers to appropriate tasks on the map. Some actions have attributes that will allow you to obtain more materials. 

You can see more details about characters and actions by hovering your mouse cursor over them. 

Keep an eye on emerging events on the panel on the right. They are crucial to survival. You can collapse them by clicking on their title bar.

Rebuild your village to gain additional actions or rewards. 

Increase esteem of countries to give your settlers a better fate after the truce ends.
 
Each villager is characterized by a set of stats, his health, his reputation, and:
<sprite index=1>  Strength
<sprite index=2>  Gathering
<sprite index=6>  Crafting
<sprite index=7>  Diplomacy
<sprite index=5>  Intelligence
 
Each point increases the number of resources harvested by 20% of the default value per point on actions of that type.  

Additionally, each diplomacy point gives a +6% bonus to the price of items sold and -6% to the price of items bought.

In addition to this, each point of intelligence causes another random stat to increase at the beginning of a new chapter.

Health represents the condition and fitness for work of a given villager. It influences the effective stats of the character. There are several levels of health:

Level 5: No modifiers.
Level 4: -1 point to all character stats.
Level 3 -2 points to all character stats.
Level 2: -3 points to all character stats.
Level 1: -4 points to all character stats.
Level 0: Causes the death of the villager.

You can increase a character's health using actions in the field hospital.

The villager's reputation affects his efficiency when interacting with a country.
