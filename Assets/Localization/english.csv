game/help/description,"During each turn, assign citizens to appropriate tasks on the map. Some actions have attributes that will allow you to obtain more materials. 

You can see more details about characters and actions by holding your mouse cursor over them. 

Keep an eye on emerging events on the panel on the right. They are crucial to survival.

Rebuild your village to gain additional actions or rewards. 

Collect reputation to give your settlers a better fate after the truce ends.
 
Each settler is characterized by a set of stats, his health, his reputation, and:
<sprite index=1> - Strength
<sprite index=2> - Gathering
<sprite index=6> - Processing
<sprite index=7> - Diplomacy
<sprite index=5> - Intelligence
 
Each point increases the number of resources harvested by 20% of the default value per point on actions of that type.  

Additionally, each diplomacy point gives a +6% bonus to the price of items sold and -6% to the price of items bought.

In addition to this, each point of intelligence causes another random stat to increase at the beginning of a new chapter.

Health represents the condition and fitness for work of a given inhabitant. It influences the effective stats of the character. There are several levels of health:

Level 4: No modifiers.
Level 3: -1 point to all character stats. 
Level 2 -2 points to all character stats.
Level 1: -4 points to all character stats.
Level 0: Causes the death of the occupant.

You can increase a character's health using actions in the field hospital.

The settler's reputation affects the effective charisma value when interacting with a country.
